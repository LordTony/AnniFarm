# AnniFarm
Log in to D2R automatically when an Annihilus charm is about to spawn.

### Running

The Program runs in python 3. You will probably need to install a few libraries if you don't have them already
```
python -m pip install pyautogui cloudscraper opencv-python beautifulsoup4
python ./openD2.py
```

### Known Bugs
* If the D2R launcher needs you to manually log in this program will fail
* If the D2R launcher decides to pop up an ad this program will fail

### Contributing
I am open to PRs and opening issues. I can't promise anything since this is my first github project, but I will try to keep this updated. Feel free to point out obvious things.
